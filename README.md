SCons Mac OS X Installer
========================

Takes a [SCons](http://www.scons.org/) release tarball and makes a standard Mac OS X GUI installer for it, which can then be used to install SCons on Mac OS X instead of needing to install via the command line.

Mac OS X installer downloads for recent SCons releases are provided:

* [SCons 2.3.0 installer for Mac OS X](https://www.dropbox.com/s/odiu33wtwyewm81/SCons-2.3.0.pkg)
* [SCons 2.2.0 installer for Mac OS X](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5vy3vmqkkinyzhb/SCons-2.2.0.pkg)
* [SCons 2.1.0 installer for Mac OS X](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m0yt8y08gl62vwg/SCons-2.1.0.pkg)
* [SCons 2.0.1 installer for Mac OS X](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9wh2mk8znus137b/SCons-2.0.1.pkg)
* [SCons 1.3.1 installer for Mac OS X](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mig2qvzphkst4sj/SCons-1.3.1.pkg)

You may need to disable GateKeeper in order to install SCons using the above installers.

Note: There is a SCons [enhancement request](http://scons.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2681) for making a Mac OS X installer a standard part of a SCons release, which would render the scripts in this repository obsolete.
